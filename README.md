## A second year undergrad student's attempt to implement a GAN using the EMNIST dataset and a lot of spare time

I promised myself I'd do a project a week, and this is one of those projects. As of 05/24 the state of the returned images from the gan look like this (this is the one that looks most like a digit):

But hopefully with a bit more tweaking they may end up looking like something that resembles a digit.
